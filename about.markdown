I'm a student pursuing a masters in bioinformatics who has his fingers in as many nerdy pots as I can.

The things I love include 3DCG, coding, video games, movies, shows, talking about said movies, games and shows and sharing what I'm passionate about with people. 

I'm already pretty good at doing stuff, I Hope that this blog helps me with the last part of sharing it :)
