Github was the first thing I had to learn to make my life easier when I started programming. Github quantifies how productive I am (which isnt a lot) by giving me graphs of how much shit I got done in that day.

I'll walk you through the installation, the basic commands and some good practices to get you started with Git and Github.

## STEP 1 : MAKE AN ACCOUNT

Just do it. Make an account. And then we'll move ahead.

## STEP 2 : INSTALL GIT
Visit the [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) homepage and download the exe suitable for your computer.

The installation is pretty straight-forward but I'll still walk you through using screenshots and try to explain each and every option as simply as I can.
