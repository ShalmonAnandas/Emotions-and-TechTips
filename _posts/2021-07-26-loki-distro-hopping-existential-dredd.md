I don't know what to talk about after just one week of starting this blog lmao. Hence, the late blog-post. Yay!

So, I’ll just talk about the things I did this past week.

I spent most of my week flip flopping between different linux-distros and trying to fix the quirks of them (I'll talk about it later cause i don't want to start this off with nerdy stuff)

I watched a lot of youtube videos. Like, a LOT of youtube videos. I watched about 6-8 hours on average with a day reaching close to 12 hours.

 I have a serious problem guys, send help. But to be fair I have youtube videos playing in the background while i'm doing computer stuff. So it's just background noise, the amount of youtube I watched with my full focus was probably way lower than that. I'm done defending myself xD.

<h2>I finished loki last week.</h2>

It was kinda fun. I liked it, so here is my review. (I watched the show weekly so my views on it could be different from most cause I didn't consume it in one big chunk, so dont come after me)

<h2>(BIG SPOILERS NOW)</h2>

So the premise of this so is basically Loki (the one at the end of avengers, not our loki that was killed by Thanos) teleports himself by using the Tesseract that gets dropped during the heist in endgame (yeah I know it's confusing and difficult to explain just watch it to figure it out) so he teleports himself to a different timeline and there the time police (The TVF) show up to take him to time prison. There he is interrogated by an officer and the officer takes his help to find another Loki who is trying to destroy the TVF, yes there are multiple Loki’s. That’s all I can say without explaining the plot of the whole show.

The plot is great. I'm glad that marvel decided to delve into the multiverse, and a lot of important lore characters were introduced in this show. I haven’t watched Wanda Vision and I’ve heard that it also plays into the multiverse stuff, it's next on my list so expect me to talk about it in the future. 

The chemistry between Loki and Mobius is the best in the show. The back and forth they have during the interrogation scenes and the way Mobius reads Loki like a book are the most fun parts of the show. The CGI is great, but we already knew that with marvel. 

The tone of the show is a bit off-beat sometimes. Some parts of the show are waaaaay slower than other parts, I think that's why I struggled to watch the show sometimes. Watching it weekly meant that when the show had a slow episode it was a chore to watch and it felt like nothing happened. I'm sure this wouldn't have been the problem if I binged it all at once.

7/10 could have split the show out equally, or released it all at once. Otherwise a good show.


<h2>So, distro-hopping.</h2>

I tried a lot of distros in the past week, I talked about 3 distros and 5 desktop environments.
I used Manjaro, Fedora, and Opensuse. I used Fedora and opensuse with gnome and tried Manjaro with  Gnome, KDE, Budgie, i3wm and bspwm.

I tried Fedora because I managed to break the manjaro install that I did at the start of the week and I didnt want to do the same thing again. Then I tried opensuse after Fedora just because I was bored and not satisfied with Fedora before coming back to Manjaro.

While using both Fedora and opensuse I missed the ease that the AUR and the arch wiki brings to using linux. I know there are fedora and opensuse alternatives to the AUR like Fedora copr and OBS (Opensuse build service) but it never felt as seamless, easy and bleeding edge like Manjaro.

But I wanted something different so first i tried KDE, which didn’t work out cause nvidia GPUs and the KDE compositor don't get along too well. I also managed to break the KDE install while updating so I had to chroot off a live USB to fix it, and after doing all that I decided to change my DE to Budgie. Which was good. But it just felt a bit off, and not as polished as other ones like Gnome or KDE. 

So from there I switched to i3wm since I've heard so much about the efficiencies of window managers and how easy they are to work with, but I couldn't stick to it as well because picom also doesn't play well with nvidia GPUs (I'm beginning to see a pattern here, nvidia fix your shit or make it open source like AMD pls) and there was screen tearing while even watching youtube videos. So I switched to bspwm thinking it would have a better compositor but surprise-surprise it used compton WHICH IS AN OLDER VERSION OF PICOM. So that was a bust and then I came back to Manjaro Gnome and it felt like home again. So I set it all up. Made a partition for windows (yes im dual booting again, I need to have photoshop and premiere, and also gaming is a plus) 

<h3>SO YAY! I'M BACK TO WHERE I STARTED BEFORE GOING ON THIS ADVENTURE</h3>

I just hope a windows update doesn't break grub again for at least the next two weeks because i don't have the patience to deal with it anymore, but it's not windows’ or linux’s fault, I did this. I brought this on myself and my computer.

<h2>On the topic of bringing things on myself</h2>

I’ve been thinking a lot recently. And now that I don't have college going so it gave me a lot of time to think about life in general, and what I've come to realise is that I need something constant like college or a job or something to keep me going.

Being without a college after graduating was scary. Because when I was in college for 3 years I didn't have to worry about what I'm going to do next year. I always had the safety net of having my life sorted for the next year.

IDK it's difficult to explain but the people who just graduated from school, or just finished uni will relate to this. Having no plan and nowhere to go is really scary so I’m going to spend the next two years getting ready to have that feeling again once I finish my masters.

This is the only advice I’ll give to someone in their final year of college right now. Just be prepared to feel clueless, because it is going to happen. No matter how many plans you have or how many colleges you have shortlisted to apply for or how many companies you are trying to get a job in, you are going to feel clueless once you graduate. 

It's like the feeling of finishing a really good show and having nothing to do, but multiplied to the umpteenth value because it's real life.

So yeah, the moral of the story is, be prepared to feel confused, distro hop a shit ton, try linux and watch loki.

I see you guys next week, same bad day, same bad blog.
