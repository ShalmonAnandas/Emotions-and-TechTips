I"<p>Im back here, just 2 days after my last blogpost.</p>

<p>I came only cause I had things to talk about. Thats a lie, I came because I no-one to talk to.</p>

<p>No, don’t get me wrong, dont pity me, I have great friends, I have a great family that supports me in anything and everything I want to do, and im not just saying that. Its tried and tested.</p>

<p>I came here cause it just felt like there was no-one to have a heart to heart with. I’m really happy with life right now, college is going good, family is good, friendships are good but it still feels empty most of the times.</p>

<p>Its like a husk of something beautiful even though there are so many things to fill it up with. Idk I dont wanna get poetic or I’ll cringe while reading this back and never upload it.</p>

<p>There is just sometimes that things lose color in the middle. And that middle patch of greyness just eats me up.</p>

<p>I dont know how to explain this, its tough and preachy, thats why I couldnt talk about this with anybody else. This will be just between us. Me and future me, hopefully.</p>

<p>I just sat here listening to music staring at the screen for the past 40 mins after writing the last line. just thinking of what else im feeling.</p>

<p>Im feeling, for sure. But I dont know how to put it in words and it pisses me off.</p>

<p>Anyway, I wont make this post a jumbled mess of random tangents and keep them in my head.</p>

<p>Ill just take my leave. and come back the next time I feel like talking to myself.</p>

<p>See you, in, idk a while.</p>
