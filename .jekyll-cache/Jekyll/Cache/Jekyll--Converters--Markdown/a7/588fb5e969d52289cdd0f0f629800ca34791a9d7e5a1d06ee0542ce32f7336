I"³<p>Github was the first thing I had to learn to make my life easier when I started programming. Github quantifies how productive I am (which isnt a lot) by giving me graphs of how much shit I got done in that day, and in my opinion, thats priceless. Version control and having copies of all the code youve written as it is on multiple computers is also good I guess. But the graphs??!! Thats some gourmet shit. <em>chefs kiss</em></p>
