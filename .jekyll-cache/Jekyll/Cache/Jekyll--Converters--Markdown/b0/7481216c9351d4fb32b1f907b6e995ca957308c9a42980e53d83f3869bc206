I"<p>So yeah, I finally caved in and started a blog. Fun!</p>

<p>To be honest, Iâ€™ve always wanted to have an outlet to talk about the things I love and do on a daily basis (Which mostly comprises of tech stuff xD) and annoying my friends and family for each and every little thing I do sends me through a guilt trip. So now Iâ€™m here. To talk about stuff and things.</p>

<p>Maintaining a website felt like a fun way to do tech stuff along with talking about my love for CG, Movies, shows, games and a whole bunch of nerd stuff.</p>

<p>So starting next week every monday. Iâ€™ll be putting up a blog post to talk about the things I did or found interesting the past week.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll be posting a few blogs throughout the week if I feel like â€œI NEED TO TALK ABOUT THIS ASAPâ€ but those will be few and far between.</p>

<p>Hope this goes well and that I dont give up 2 weeks in. ğŸ˜‚</p>
