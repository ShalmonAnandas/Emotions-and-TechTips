I"ÿ<p>Oh man, Its been over 3 months since I last saw you. Hi! How are you doing?</p>

<p>Anyway, Back to the title of this post, Imposter Syndrome. Its real guys and, its bad. Not gonna lie Iâ€™ve been doing good in life recently. Its been real fun. The hard work is finally paying off. I mean â€œhard-workâ€ wasnâ€™t that hard now that I look back at it, but, while I was living it, it was nothing short of a nightmare.</p>

<p>Even though Iâ€™ve gotten here by doing the right things. I got here on my own. I mean there was help, ofcourse there was, but, I proved myself after I was helped. But it still feels like I donâ€™t belong here. Still feels like Iâ€™ll slip up somewhere and everybody will find out how unconfident I am, how much I doubt myself. It feels like I will go back to how I was a few years back and lose everything Iâ€™ve worked so hard for. I donâ€™t know if you guys go through it. I donâ€™t think its a phenomenon unique to me, but, it still feels like Iâ€™m isolated in this. Feels like Iâ€™ve never seen this happen in the people around me.</p>

<p>Im scared, Iâ€™m so scared that Iâ€™ll just suddenly give up trying and shit will go back to how it was. I hope I dont, but, thatâ€™s not in the power of my present self. Shitâ€™s gonna be sad if I fail.</p>

<p>I wasted the past 5 years of my life doing nothing. I donâ€™t want to go back to that. I wake up everyday in a cold sweat, afraid that I fucked up. Iâ€™m sure this will go. It has to be a passing emotion. But man does it feel so real right now.</p>
